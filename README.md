# Objective:
My task is to create a portfolio using React skills that have been aquired throughout this bootcamp.

# Description:
Welcome to My Portfolio! I have learned so much these past 3 months, and I am excited to show you some of the skills I have learned as a web developer.

# Installation
In VS Code, open up the integrated terminal and type command "npm install". Once all packages have been installed, you will need to follow the next set of instruction to deploy my React portfolio through Netlify.

Once portfolio has been deployed you will have access to My Reaction Portfolio.

# Usage and Future Improvements
This portfolio application is a great way for you to show you current work to friends, colleagues, and future employeers. In this appllication, you have access to some of the projects that I completed through out my bootcamp. You also have a means of contacting me and reviewing my resume.

## Future Improvements:
My portfolio is currently missing my resume. However, once it has been updated, it will be added to my portfolio. Also I would like to make the project page more dynamic by displaying images or gifs of my projects.
